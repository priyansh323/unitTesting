-->Three CONVERSION methods are Enclosd in three Differernt ** Describe ** Method under which test cases of each method are written in total 17 test cases are there .

--> In Fuel Efficiency to mpg flow in ElseIF{IF} part the conversion Formula is incorrect 
               
==== STEPS TO EXCEUTE TEST FILE ====
* NPM should be install in the Machine ( npm init)
* Install Jest in your machine ( npm install --save-dev jest )
* File directory should be inside Project 
* Use command to run test Cases ( npm run test)
* for coverage report got the location specified above                             
                             
                             
                             
                             *** DETAILS WHAT EACH TEST CASE DO ***

-- isValidFunction --> TO Check if fuelUnitConversion is a valid Function or Not.

-- isIfOutputCorrect --> TO Check the code flow in "If" Statement  & output recieved from it is in valid JSON Format 
                        or NOT plus the value recieved(i.e Unit) Matches the expected value.

-- isElseIfOutputCorrect --> TO Check the code flow in "ElseIf" Statement & output recieved from it is in valid JSON Format 
                             or NOT plus the value recieved(i.e Unit) Matches the expected value.

-- isIfOutputCorrect --> TO Check if  Output Value(i.e Converted Value) is Correct/Expected or not. 

-- isValidJson --> When called Checks the Object is in Valid Json Format & it's in Every Describe method

-- isValidFunction --> TO Check if currencyConversion is a valid Function or Not.

-- isIfOutputCorrect  --> TO Check the code flow in "If" Statement  & output recieved from it is in valid JSON Format or NOT.

-- isIfElseOutputCorrect --> TO Check the code flow in "Else IF" Statement  & output recieved from it is in valid JSON Format or NOT.

-- isElseOutputCorrect --> TO Check the code flow in "Else" Statement  & output recieved from it is in valid JSON Format or NOT.

-- isIfFormulaCorrect --> TO Check  If Currency Conversion Formula is Correct In "IF" Statement and converting the given values as Expected or Not.

-- isElseIfFormulaCorrect --> TO Check  If Currency Conversion Formula is Correct In " ElseIF" Statement and converting the given values as Expected or Not.

-- isElseFormulaCorrect --> TO Check  If Currency Conversion Formula is Correct In " Else" Statement and converting the given values as Expected or Not.

****
-- isValidFunction --> TO Check if convertToUSMpg is a valid Function or Not.

-- isOutputValid -->TO Check if the convertToUSMpg function return Desired Format Output or not 

-- isIfWorking --> TO Check if in convertToUSMpg function when the code flows in "if" Statement the code  is working as Expected & also when parameters passed are 
                   [units  -> mpg  &  Country -> GBR] the recieved output is as Expected.

-- mpgToMpgConversion --> TO Check if in convertToUSMpg function When the Parameters passed as [{ units --> mpg  &  Country --> INR}]  the code works as Expected and value recieved matches to Expected Value

-- isElse_IfWorking --> TO Check if in convertToUSMpg function when the code flows in "Elseif"--->"If" Statement the code  is working as Expected & also when parameters passed are 
[units  -> ukMpg  &  Country -> ENG] the recieved output is as Expected.

-- isElseIf_ElseWorking -->  TO Check if in convertToUSMpg function when the code flows in "Elseif"--->"Else" Statement the code  is working as Expected & also when parameters passed are 
                              [units  -> ukMpg  &  Country -> ENG] the recieved output is as Expected.
